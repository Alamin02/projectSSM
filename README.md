# Project SSM
It is a sea level and salinity monitoring system built as a class project. 
it collects data from the monitoring device and shows it realtime on the website.
It also shows the stored data in D3 graphical representation

### Drawback
I've designed the system for a single device only, but this can be extended to any amount of devices.
